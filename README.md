# Elections-Model
This repo contains code for my prediction model for the USA 2020 presidential elections. It was created by Prinsa Gandhi. The purpose is to create a report which will summarize the results of my generalized linear model. I am unable to publicly share the data used in this model, but steps to obtain this data is shown below. The sections of this repo are input, output and scripts. 

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. I used two datasets:
-[survey data:detail how to get survey data]
-[ACS data:detail how to get census data]

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report and supporting material. 

-x
-y

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. 
These are:
#00_data_gathering.R
01_data_cleaning.R
02_data_preperation.R
